The aim of the present study was to determine whether intravenous administration of 2 mg tropisetron daily for a limited period of time would produce quicker and more favorable results. In the first cohort 18 fibromyalgia patients received a single intravenous injection of 2 mg tropisetron. In the second cohort 24 fibromyalgia patients were treated with 2 mg intravenous tropisetron daily for 5 days. Pain intensity was measured with the visual analog scale and the pain score. Pain at tender and control points (dolorimeter) as well as 17 ancillary symptoms before and after treatment were evaluated. Pain intensity was followed-up by means of a patient diary until recurrence. Dolorimetry revealed that a single intravenous injection of 2 mg tropisetron significantly reduced pain and enhanced pain threshold. These effects, however, lasted for only a few days. Of 18 patients in the first cohort, only three showed no response to therapy. Of the 24 patients in the second cohort, 23 showed pain reduction when 2 mg tropisetron was administered daily for 5 days. Pain relief lasted for 2 weeks to 2 months in 20 of these patients. Two patients stopped filling in the pain diary. Twelve ancillary symptoms such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, morning stiffness were also significantly improved by the latter treatment.

To investigate the potential of management of endocrine abnormalities for relieve of symptoms of patients with fibromyalgia, we reviewed experimental and clinical studies of endocrine functioning and endocrine treatment. Serum GH, androgen, and 24-hour urinary cortisol levels of patients with fibromyalgia tend to be in the lower part of the normal range, while serum levels of thyroid hormone, female sex hormones, prolactin, and melatonin are normal. With exception of GH, these conclusions are based on studies in small samples. With respect to dynamic responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the dexamethasone suppression test and stimulation with ACTH show normal results, while patients show marked ACTH hypersecretion in response to severe acute stressors, perhaps indicative of chronic CRH hyposecretion. This finding and slightly altered responsiveness of growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and prolactin in pharmacologic stimulation tests suggest a central rather than peripheral origin of endocrine deviations. Because hormone level deviations were not severe, occurred in subgroups of patients only, and few controlled clinical trials were performed, there is--unless future research shows otherwise--little support for hormone supplementation as a general therapy in the common patient with fibromyalgia.

"Finally , the pharmacological manipulation of the sympathetic-immune interface is reviewed with focus on new therapeutic strategies using selective alpha(2)- and beta(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type IV in the treatment of experimental models of autoimmune diseases , fibromyalgia , and chronic fatigue syndrome .",The sympathetic nerve--an integrative interface between two supersystems: the brain and the immune system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11121511/,"The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. During an immune response the brain and the immune system ""talk to each other"" and this process is essential for maintaining homeostasis. Two major pathway systems are involved in this cross-talk: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). This overview focuses on the role of SNS in neuroimmune interactions, an area that has received much less attention than the role of HPA axis. Evidence accumulated over the last 20 years suggests that norepinephrine (NE) fulfills the criteria for neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in lymphoid organs. Thus, primary and secondary lymphoid organs receive extensive sympathetic/noradrenergic innervation. Under stimulation, NE is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in these organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released NE, or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine, affect lymphocyte traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells. Although there exists substantial sympathetic innervation in the bone marrow, and particularly in the thymus and mucosal tissues, our knowledge about the effect of the sympathetic neural input on hematopoiesis, thymocyte development, and mucosal immunity is extremely modest. In addition, recent evidence is discussed that NE and epinephrine, through stimulation of the beta(2)-adrenoreceptor-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, inhibit the production of type 1/proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma by antigen-presenting cells and T helper (Th) 1 cells, whereas they stimulate the production of type 2/anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. Through this mechanism, systemically, endogenous catecholamines may cause a selective suppression of Th1 responses and cellular immunity, and a Th2 shift toward dominance of humoral immunity. On the other hand, in certain local responses, and under certain conditions, catecholamines may actually boost regional immune responses, through induction of IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and primarily IL-8 production. Thus, the activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response, through induction of neutrophil accumulation and stimulation of more specific humoral immune responses, although systemically it may suppress Th1 responses, and, thus protect the organism from the detrimental effects of proinflammatory cytokines and other products of activated macrophages. The above-mentioned immunomodulatory effects of catecholamines and the role of SNS are also discussed in the context of their clinical implication in certain infections, major injury and sepsis, autoimmunity, chronic pain and fatigue syndromes, and tumor growth. Finally, the pharmacological manipulation of the sympathetic-immune interface is reviewed with focus on new therapeutic strategies using selective alpha(2)- and beta(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type IV in the treatment of experimental models of autoimmune diseases, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome.",11121511,2001-01-04,"['Cytokines', 'Growth Substances', 'Neuropeptide Y', 'Receptors, Adrenergic', 'Norepinephrine']","The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body.

FM can be either primary (idiopathic) or secondary. MPS is always secondary to some muscle stressor. The diagnosis of these conditions is generally made by physical examination. Algometry can quantify the tenderness. EMG of the trigger point and diagnostic ultrasound can provide objective evidence of the trigger point. Biochemical markers and other phenomena associated with FM have not yet been shown to be either specific or sensitive enough to use as clinical indicators of the condition. Tryptophane is low in the serum and spinal fluid of FM patients, whereas substance P is elevated in the spinal fluid. Treatment of MPS is effective when the trigger point is inactivated and underlying mechanical or medical perpetuating factors are corrected. Treatment of fibromyalgia is more difficult as the drugs commonly used, such as the tricyclic antidepressants, which have uncertain benefits; and exercise, which clearly shows a short-term benefit, fail to provide long-lasting relief at 4 years.

"WBC is used to relieve pain and inflammatory symptoms caused by numerous disorders , particularly those associated with rheumatic conditions , and is recommended for the treatment of arthritis , fibromyalgia and ankylosing spondylitis .",Whole-body cryotherapy in athletes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20524715/,"Cold therapy is commonly used as a procedure to relieve pain symptoms, particularly in inflammatory diseases, injuries and overuse symptoms. A peculiar form of cold therapy (or stimulation) was proposed 30 years ago for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. The therapy, called whole-body cryotherapy (WBC), consists of exposure to very cold air that is maintained at -110 degrees C to -140 degrees C in special temperature-controlled cryochambers, generally for 2 minutes. WBC is used to relieve pain and inflammatory symptoms caused by numerous disorders, particularly those associated with rheumatic conditions, and is recommended for the treatment of arthritis, fibromyalgia and ankylosing spondylitis. In sports medicine, WBC has gained wider acceptance as a method to improve recovery from muscle injury. Unfortunately, there are few papers concerning the application of the treatment on athletes. The study of possible enhancement of recovery from injuries and possible modification of physiological parameters, taking into consideration the limits imposed by antidoping rules, is crucial for athletes and sports physicians for judging the real benefits and/or limits of WBC. According to the available literature, WBC is not harmful or detrimental in healthy subjects. The treatment does not enhance bone marrow production and could reduce the sport-induced haemolysis. WBC induces oxidative stress, but at a low level. Repeated treatments are apparently not able to induce cumulative effects; on the contrary, adaptive changes on antioxidant status are elicited--the adaptation is evident where WBC precedes or accompanies intense training. WBC is not characterized by modifications of immunological markers and leukocytes, and it seems to not be harmful to the immunological system. The WBC effect is probably linked to the modifications of immunological molecules having paracrine effects, and not to systemic immunological functions. In fact, there is an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, and a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine IL-2 and chemokine IL-8. Moreover, the decrease in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 supported the anti-inflammatory response. Lysosomal membranes are stabilized by WBC, reducing potential negative effects on proteins of lysosomal enzymes. The cold stimulation shows positive effects on the muscular enzymes creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and it should be considered a procedure that facilitates athletes' recovery. Cardiac markers troponin I and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, parameters linked to damage and necrosis of cardiac muscular tissue, but also to tissue repair, were unchanged, demonstrating that there was no damage, even minimal, in the heart during the treatment. N-Terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a parameter linked to heart failure and ventricular power decrease, showed an increase, due to cold stress. However, the NT-proBNP concentrations observed after WBC were lower than those measured after a heavy training session, suggesting that the treatment limits the increase of the parameter that is typical of physical exercise. WBC did not stimulate the pituitary-adrenal cortex axis: the hormonal modifications are linked mainly to the body's adaptation to the stress, shown by an increase of noradrenaline (norepinephrine). We conclude that WBC is not harmful and does not induce general or specific negative effects in athletes. The treatment does not induce modifications of biochemical and haematological parameters, which could be suspected in athletes who may be cheating. The published data are generally not controversial, but further studies are necessary to confirm the present observations.",20524715,2010-09-15,,"Cold therapy is commonly used as a procedure to relieve pain symptoms, particularly in inflammatory diseases, injuries and overuse symptoms.

"While trazodone has only been FDA approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder , it has been used off label for numerous conditions including insomnia , anxiety , dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , substance abuse , schizophrenia , bulimia , and fibromyalgia .",Other Antidepressants.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30194544/,"This chapter addresses the following FDA-approved medications for the treatment of major depressive disorder available for use in the United States including bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, vortioxetine, and vilazodone. These medications do not belong to one of the previously featured classes of antidepressants discussed in the preceding chapters. Each medication featured in this chapter has a unique structure and properties that target diverse receptors in the central nervous system. These diverse targets are distinct from other classes of medications used to treat major depressive disorder. This chapter will provide an overview of each medication's indication for use, history of development, pharmacology, metabolism, dosing recommendations, onset of action, use in special populations, safety and tolerability, adverse effects, potential interactions with additional medications, and data regarding possible overdose with available treatments.Bupropion was initially developed for its combined effects on the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters. Currently, bupropion is the only antidepressant on the market in the United States with no appreciable activity on serotonin concentrations in the central nervous system. Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans into three active metabolites including hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobuproprion each with substantial antidepressant activity. The most serious side effect of bupropion is the development of seizures, so the dose must be gradually titrated to a maximum dose of 450 mg per day of the immediate-release formulation and 400 mg per day of the sustained-release formulation. Additional adverse effects include agitation, dry mouth, insomnia, headaches, migraines, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and tremor. The onset of action of bupropion is 2 weeks with full efficacy attained at 4 weeks of treatment. Bupropion produced similar depression remission rates when compared to SSRIs with a median time to relapse of 44 weeks. Bupropion has additionally been approved for smoking cessation and may have a combined role in treating nicotine cravings and depression.Mirtazapine has a unique method of action by enhancing norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission by blocking the alpha-2 presynaptic adrenoceptors resulting in increased release of serotonin at the nerve terminals. Mirtazapine additionally binds to the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>1</sub> receptors resulting in increased sedation, which is the most common side effect. Additional side effects include increased appetite and weight gain, dizziness, and transient elevations in cholesterol levels and liver function tests. Mirtazapine is unlike any other antidepressant in that it also has a hormonal effect that reduces cortisol levels within the body. Patients on mirtazapine showed significant improvement in symptoms of major depressive disorder within the first 1-2 weeks of treatment with long-term studies at 40 weeks showing continued improvements in response rates in addition to lower relapse rates. Mirtazapine has an antagonistic effect at the central presynaptic 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors and alpha-2 adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors resulting in increased norepinephrine release with an indirect release of serotonin due to increased noradrenergic input to the raphe nucleus. Mirtazapine has an effective dose range from 15 to 45 mg once daily with a long half-life preventing dose adjustments more often than every 1-2 weeks.Trazadone is a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonist and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. While trazodone has only been FDA approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder, it has been used off label for numerous conditions including insomnia, anxiety, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, substance abuse, schizophrenia, bulimia, and fibromyalgia. The most common adverse reaction is drowsiness, followed by dizziness, dry mouth, and nervousness. In the United States, trazadone is the second most commonly prescribed agent used to treat insomnia. The hypnotic action of this medication at lower doses is attributed primarily to the antagonism of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, H<sub>1</sub> receptors, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. The most active metabolite is m-chlorophenylpiperazine produced by the CYP<sub>3A4</sub> enzyme, which is a more profound inhibitor of serotonin reuptake as compared to the parent molecule of trazadone. The maximum outpatient dose should not exceed 400 mg per day in divided doses, but in hospitalized patients, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 600 mg daily in divided doses while the patient is being actively monitored for side effects. One third of inpatients and one half of outpatients had a significant therapeutic response to trazadone by the end of the first week with the remainder of patients responding in 2-4 weeks of therapy.Vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant classified by the World Health Organization as a N06AX antidepressant that was derived from studies targeting the combination of direct serotonin transporter inhibition and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor modulation leading to rapid desensitization of the somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors and activation of the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. This medication is an antagonist at 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors, an agonist at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, and a partial agonist at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors. Blockade of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor was noted to produce increased levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and histamine in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are known to be associated with the development of depression. The most common adverse effect is nausea followed by sexual dysfunction, constipation, and vomiting. The maximum dose of vortioxetine is 20 mg daily with improvement in symptoms of depression noted at 2 weeks with a full therapeutic effect observed at 4-6 weeks.Vilazodone is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist. This medication works by enhancing serotonergic activity in the central nervous system through selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake with no significant effects noted on norepinephrine or dopamine uptake. Vilazodone additionally binds with high affinity to the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors as a partial agonist resulting in faster onset of action, greater efficacy, and better tolerability with reduced sexual side effects when compared to other SSRIs. The most common adverse effects were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia. Additional reported adverse effects included dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, abnormal dreams, decreased libido, arthralgias, and palpitations which were self-limited with resolution in 4-5 days after starting the medication. The recommended therapeutic dose of vilazodone is 40 mg daily with improvement noted in depressive symptoms within 1 week of initiating therapy with increased remission rates noted at 6 weeks of therapy.The medications featured in this chapter do not fall within the major categories of antidepressant classes but add additional unique mechanisms for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Each medication targets different receptors in the central nervous system involved in the development of depression. Resolution of depressive symptoms and response rates of these medications are similar to SSRIs with reduced side effects that can often lead to discontinuation of therapy. Use of these unique medications allows clinicians to target specific symptoms and comorbidities often associated with depression resulting in improved symptom resolution and long-term maintenance of remission.",30194544,2019-07-22,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors', 'Serotonin', 'Mirtazapine']","This chapter addresses the following FDA-approved medications for the treatment of major depressive disorder available for use in the United States including bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, vortioxetine, and vilazodone. These medications do not belong to one of the previously featured classes of antidepressants discussed in the preceding chapters. Each medication featured in this chapter has a unique structure and properties that target diverse receptors in the central nervous system. These diverse targets are distinct from other classes of medications used to treat major depressive disorder. This chapter will provide an overview of each medication's indication for use, history of development, pharmacology, metabolism, dosing recommendations, onset of action, use in special populations, safety and tolerability, adverse effects, potential interactions with additional medications, and data regarding possible overdose with available treatments.Bupropion was initially developed for its combined effects on the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters. Currently, bupropion is the only antidepressant on the market in the United States with no appreciable activity on serotonin concentrations in the central nervous system. Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans into three active metabolites including hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobuproprion each with substantial antidepressant activity. The most serious side effect of bupropion is the development of seizures, so the dose must be gradually titrated to a maximum dose of 450 mg per day of the immediate-release formulation and 400 mg per day of the sustained-release formulation. Additional adverse effects include agitation, dry mouth, insomnia, headaches, migraines, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and tremor. The onset of action of bupropion is 2 weeks with full efficacy attained at 4 weeks of treatment. Bupropion produced similar depression remission rates when compared to SSRIs with a median time to relapse of 44 weeks. Bupropion has additionally been approved for smoking cessation and may have a combined role in treating nicotine cravings and depression.Mirtazapine has a unique method of action by enhancing norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission by blocking the alpha-2 presynaptic adrenoceptors resulting in increased release of serotonin at the nerve terminals. Mirtazapine additionally binds to the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>1</sub> receptors resulting in increased sedation, which is the most common side effect. Additional side effects include increased appetite and weight gain, dizziness, and transient elevations in cholesterol levels and liver function tests. Mirtazapine is unlike any other antidepressant in that it also has a hormonal effect that reduces cortisol levels within the body. Patients on mirtazapine showed significant improvement in symptoms of major depressive disorder within the first 1-2 weeks of treatment with long-term studies at 40 weeks showing continued improvements in response rates in addition to lower relapse rates. Mirtazapine has an antagonistic effect at the central presynaptic 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors and alpha-2 adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors resulting in increased norepinephrine release with an indirect release of serotonin due to increased noradrenergic input to the raphe nucleus. Mirtazapine has an effective dose range from 15 to 45 mg once daily with a long half-life preventing dose adjustments more often than every 1-2 weeks.Trazadone is a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonist and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. While trazodone has only been FDA approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder, it has been used off label for numerous conditions including insomnia, anxiety, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, substance abuse, schizophrenia, bulimia, and fibromyalgia. The most common adverse reaction is drowsiness, followed by dizziness, dry mouth, and nervousness. In the United States, trazadone is the second most commonly prescribed agent used to treat insomnia. The hypnotic action of this medication at lower doses is attributed primarily to the antagonism of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, H<sub>1</sub> receptors, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. The most active metabolite is m-chlorophenylpiperazine produced by the CYP<sub>3A4</sub> enzyme, which is a more profound inhibitor of serotonin reuptake as compared to the parent molecule of trazadone. The maximum outpatient dose should not exceed 400 mg per day in divided doses, but in hospitalized patients, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 600 mg daily in divided doses while the patient is being actively monitored for side effects. One third of inpatients and one half of outpatients had a significant therapeutic response to trazadone by the end of the first week with the remainder of patients responding in 2-4 weeks of therapy.Vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant classified by the World Health Organization as a N06AX antidepressant that was derived from studies targeting the combination of direct serotonin transporter inhibition and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor modulation leading to rapid desensitization of the somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors and activation of the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. This medication is an antagonist at 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors, an agonist at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, and a partial agonist at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors. Blockade of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor was noted to produce increased levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and histamine in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are known to be associated with the development of depression. The most common adverse effect is nausea followed by sexual dysfunction, constipation, and vomiting. The maximum dose of vortioxetine is 20 mg daily with improvement in symptoms of depression noted at 2 weeks with a full therapeutic effect observed at 4-6 weeks.Vilazodone is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist. This medication works by enhancing serotonergic activity in the central nervous system through selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake with no significant effects noted on norepinephrine or dopamine uptake. Vilazodone additionally binds with high affinity to the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors as a partial agonist resulting in faster onset of action, greater efficacy, and better tolerability with reduced sexual side effects when compared to other SSRIs. The most common adverse effects were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia. Additional reported adverse effects included dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, abnormal dreams, decreased libido, arthralgias, and palpitations which were self-limited with resolution in 4-5 days after starting the medication. The recommended therapeutic dose of vilazodone is 40 mg daily with improvement noted in depressive symptoms within 1 week of initiating therapy with increased remission rates noted at 6 weeks of therapy.The medications featured in this chapter do not fall within the major categories of antidepressant classes but add additional unique mechanisms for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a nonarticular rheumatological syndrome associated with diverse clinical and psychological features. One of the major complaints in FM is reduced pain tolerance, especially in tender points (TP) for which patients derive significant benefit from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. Patients with FM also have altered reactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis where the predominant feature is reduced containment of the stress response system through diminished adrenocortical output and feedback resistance. Our results show that mud packs together with antidepressant treatment are able to influence the HPA axis, stimulating increased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and beta-endorphin serum levels. The discharge of corticoids in the blood and the increase in beta-endorphin serum levels are followed by a reduction in pain symptoms, which is closely related to an improvement in disability, depression and quality of life. It seems that the synergic association between a pharmacological treatment (trazodone) and mud packs acts by helping the physiological responses to achieve homeostasis and to rebalance the stress response system.

However, clinical data have reported incidence or exacerbation of heart failure following PRG administration. Experimental data exploring cardiac alterations and its underlying mechanisms are quite scarce. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of PRG on morphometric, echocardiographic, neurohumoral, and histopathological parameters in rats. It was hypothesized that alterations in cardiac renin angiotensin system (RAS) might be involved in PRG-induced cardiotoxicity. To further emphasize the role of RAS in the mechanism of PRG-induced cardiotoxicity, the protective potential of diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, was investigated. Results showed 44% decrease in ejection fraction and sevenfold increase in plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Histopathological examination also showed prominent vacuolar changes and edema in cardiomyocytes. In addition, PRG significantly increased angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) levels, while decreased angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Mas receptor (MasR) cardiac levels. DIZE co-administration showed prominent protection against PRG-induced echocardiographic, neurohumoral, and histopathological alterations in rats. In addition, downregulation of ACE/Ang II/AT1R and upregulation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR axes were noted in DIZE co-treated rats. These findings showed, for the first time, the detailed cardiac deleterious effects of PRG in rats.

"This review provides an overview of research addressing the effectiveness of ST as an intervention for the prevention or treatment of the adverse consequences of ( i ) aging muscle ; ( ii ) the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) and its components , i.e. insulin resistance , abdominal obesity , hyperlipidaemia and hypertension ; ( iii ) fibromyalgia ; ( iv ) rheumatoid arthritis ; and ( v ) Alzheimer 's disease .",Strength training as a countermeasure to aging muscle and chronic disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21425888/,"Strength training (ST) has long been considered a promising intervention for reversing the loss of muscle function and the deterioration of muscle structure associated with advanced age but, until recently, the evidence was insufficient to support its role in the prevention or treatment of disease. In recent decades, there has been a long list of quality reviews examining the effects of ST on functional abilities and a few on risk factors for specific diseases, but none have provided a comprehensive assessment of ST as an intervention for a broad range of diseases. This review provides an overview of research addressing the effectiveness of ST as an intervention for the prevention or treatment of the adverse consequences of (i) aging muscle; (ii) the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, i.e. insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension; (iii) fibromyalgia; (iv) rheumatoid arthritis; and (v) Alzheimer's disease. Collectively, these studies indicate that ST may serve as an effective countermeasure to some of the adverse consequences of the MetS, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence in support of the hypothesis that ST reduces insulin resistance or improves insulin action comes both from indirect biomarkers, such as glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), and insulin responses to oral glucose tolerance tests, as well as from more direct procedures such as hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp techniques. The evidence for the use of ST as a countermeasure of abdominal obesity is less convincing. Although some reports show statistically significant reductions in visceral fat, it is unclear if the magnitude of these changes are physiologically meaningful and if they are independent of dietary influences. The efficacy of ST as an intervention for reducing dyslipidaemia is at best inconsistent, particularly when compared with other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as aerobic exercise training. However, there is more consistent evidence for the effectiveness of ST in reducing triglyceride levels. This finding could have clinical significance, given that elevated triglyceride is one of the five criterion measures for the diagnosis of the MetS. Small to moderate reductions in resting and exercise blood pressure have been reported with some indication that this effect may be genotype dependent. ST improves or reverses some of the adverse effects of fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, particularly pain, inflammation, muscle weakness and fatigue. Investigations are needed to determine how these effects compare with those elicited from aerobic exercise training and/or standard treatments. There is no evidence that ST can reverse any of the major biological or behavioural outcomes of Alzheimer's disease, but there is evidence that the prevalence of this disease is inversely associated with muscle mass and strength. Some indicators of cognitive function may also improve with ST. Thus, ST is an effective countermeasure for some of the adverse effects experienced by patients of many chronic diseases, as discussed in this review.",21425888,2011-07-11,,"Strength training (ST) has long been considered a promising intervention for reversing the loss of muscle function and the deterioration of muscle structure associated with advanced age but, until recently, the evidence was insufficient to support its role in the prevention or treatment of disease. In recent decades, there has been a long list of quality reviews examining the effects of ST on functional abilities and a few on risk factors for specific diseases, but none have provided a comprehensive assessment of ST as an intervention for a broad range of diseases. This review provides an overview of research addressing the effectiveness of ST as an intervention for the prevention or treatment of the adverse consequences of (i) aging muscle; (ii) the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, i.e. insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension; (iii) fibromyalgia; (iv) rheumatoid arthritis; and (v) Alzheimer's disease. Collectively, these studies indicate that ST may serve as an effective countermeasure to some of the adverse consequences of the MetS, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence in support of the hypothesis that ST reduces insulin resistance or improves insulin action comes both from indirect biomarkers, such as glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), and insulin responses to oral glucose tolerance tests, as well as from more direct procedures such as hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp techniques. The evidence for the use of ST as a countermeasure of abdominal obesity is less convincing. Although some reports show statistically significant reductions in visceral fat, it is unclear if the magnitude of these changes are physiologically meaningful and if they are independent of dietary influences. The efficacy of ST as an intervention for reducing dyslipidaemia is at best inconsistent, particularly when compared with other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as aerobic exercise training. However, there is more consistent evidence for the effectiveness of ST in reducing triglyceride levels. This finding could have clinical significance, given that elevated triglyceride is one of the five criterion measures for the diagnosis of the MetS. Small to moderate reductions in resting and exercise blood pressure have been reported with some indication that this effect may be genotype dependent. ST improves or reverses some of the adverse effects of fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, particularly pain, inflammation, muscle weakness and fatigue. Investigations are needed to determine how these effects compare with those elicited from aerobic exercise training and/or standard treatments. There is no evidence that ST can reverse any of the major biological or behavioural outcomes of Alzheimer's disease, but there is evidence that the prevalence of this disease is inversely associated with muscle mass and strength. Some indicators of cognitive function may also improve with ST. Thus, ST is an effective countermeasure for some of the adverse effects experienced by patients of many chronic diseases, as discussed in this review.","{'Year': '2011', 'Month': 'Apr', 'Day': '01'}","this review provides an overview of research addressing the effectiveness of st as an intervention for the prevention or treatment of the adverse consequences of ( i ) aging muscle ; ( ii ) the metabolic syndrome ( mets ) and its components , i.e. insulin resistance , abdominal obesity , hyperlipidaemia and hypertension ; ( iii ) fibromyalgia ; ( iv ) rheumatoid arthritis ; and ( v ) alzheimer 's disease .","<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">this review provides an overview of research addressing the effectiveness of st as an intervention for the prevention or treatment of the adverse consequences of ( i ) aging

The major symptoms of fibromyalgia include multifocal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive or memory problems. Other symptoms may include psychological distress, impaired functioning, and sexual dysfunction. The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia remains uncertain but is believed to be largely central in nature. In 1990 the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published diagnostic research criteria for fibromyalgia. The criteria included a history of chronic and widespread pain and the presence of 11 or more out of 18 tender points. Pain was considered chronic widespread when all of the following are present: pain in the left side of the body; pain in the right side of the body; pain above the waist; pain below the waist. In addition, axial skeletal pain must be present and the duration of pain must be more than 3 months. A tender point is considered positive when pain can be elicited by pressures of 4 kg/cm2 or less. For tender points to be considered positive, the patient must perceive the palpation as painful; tenderness to palpation is not sufficient. However, over the next 20 years it became increasingly appreciated that the focus on tender points was not justified. In 2010 a similar group of investigators performed a multicenter study of 829 previously diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and controls using physician physical and interview examinations, including a widespread pain index (WPI), a measure of the number of painful body regions. Random forest and recursive partitioning analyses were used to guide the development of a case definition of fibromyalgia, to develop new preliminary ACR diagnostic criteria, and to construct a symptom severity (SS) scale. The most important diagnostic variables were WPI and categorical scales for cognitive symptoms, un-refreshed sleep, fatigue, and number of somatic symptoms. The categorical scales were summed to create an SS scale. The investigators combined the SS scale and the WPI to recommend a new case definition of fibromyalgia: (WPI &gt; or = 7 AND SS &gt; or = 5).

Although generalized severe pain is considered to be the cardinal symptom of the disease, many other associated symptoms, especially non-restorative sleep, chronic fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms also play a relevant role in the degree of disability characteristic of the disease. Ozone therapy, which is used to treat a wide range of diseases and seems to be particularly useful in the treatment of many chronic diseases, is thought to act by exerting a mild, transient, and controlled oxidative stress that promotes an up-regulation of the antioxidant system and a modulation of the immune system. According to these mechanisms of action, it was hypothesized that ozone therapy could be useful in fibromyalgia management, where the employed therapies are very often ineffective.","{'Year': '2019', 'Month': 'Feb'}","in conclusion , at our knowledge , this is the largest study of patients with fibromyalgia treated with ozone therapy reported in the literature and it demonstrates that the ozone therapy is an effective treatment for fibromyalgia patients without significant side effects .","<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">in conclusion , at our knowledge , this is the largest study of

"Therefore , we evaluated low ( 1   W ) , intermediate ( 42   W ) and high level ( 75   W ) HILT in a woman with long-standing fibromyalgia syndrome which was resistant to both standard pharmacotherapy and treatment in an interdisciplinary pain management program .",Treatment of drug-resistant fibromyalgia symptoms using high-intensity laser therapy: a case-based review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080932/,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal condition characterized by widespread pain in the body and is associated with tender points at the shoulder, back and hip regions. A wide variety of pharmacologic drugs and dietary supplements have been used with limited success in treating the musculoskeletal pain. Early clinical studies with low level laser therapy (LLLT) alone or in combination with drugs commonly used to treat fibromyalgia suggested that LLLT may be effective in reducing musculoskeletal pain and stiffness, as well as the number of tender locations. However, a sham-controlled study reported that LLLT was not significantly better than the sham treatment and kinesiotape. Preliminary studies with high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) suggest that it may be more effective than LLLT for treating chronic pain syndromes. Therefore, we evaluated low (1 W), intermediate (42 W) and high level (75 W) HILT in a woman with long-standing fibromyalgia syndrome which was resistant to both standard pharmacotherapy and treatment in an interdisciplinary pain management program.

Melatonin seems to be the natural hormone to facilitate sleep in insomniac patients and causes no hang over. When applied together with benzodiazepine it allows reduction of benzodiazepine without withdrawal effects. It should be applied 2 h before sleeping time in doses between 3 and 5 mg. Melatonin acts via the gamma-aminobutyric acid- and benzodiazepine receptor explaining its success in treatment of seizures in children and in adults. Constant application of benzodiazepine reduced the production of natural melatonin in rats, supporting the evidence that long-term application of benzodiazepine in humans does not restore sleeping habits but reduces natural sleeping habits even more. Low melatonin levels were seen in bulimia or neuralgia and in women with fibromyalgia; replacement reduced pain, sleeping disorders, and depression in fibromyalgia and bulimia. Melatonin profiles are a diagnostic tool to distinguish between several forms of depression, like major depression, winter depression (SAD), unipolar depression, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In patients with a major depression success with antidepressants correlated with an increase in their melatonin profiles but only patients suffering from DSPS can be successfully treated with melatonin. In perimenopausal women melatonin administration did produce a change in LH, FSH and thyroid hormones. Some oncostatic properties are supported by cell culture work and studies in animals.

The goal of this study was to assess the effects of unilateral rTMS of the motor cortex on chronic widespread pain in patients with fibromyalgia. Thirty patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (age: 52.6 +/- 7.9) were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to two groups, one receiving active rTMS (n = 15) and the other sham stimulation (n = 15), applied to the left primary motor cortex in 10 daily sessions. The primary outcome measure was self-reported average pain intensity over the last 24 h, measured at baseline, daily during the stimulation period and then 15, 30 and 60 days after the first stimulation.

Follow-up data were obtained for all the patients on days 15 and 30 and for 26 patients (13 in each treatment group) on day 60. Active rTMS significantly reduced pain and improved several aspects of quality of life (including fatigue, morning tiredness, general activity, walking and sleep) for up to 2 weeks after treatment had ended. The analgesic effects were observed from the fifth stimulation onwards and were not related to changes in mood or anxiety.

Follow-up data were obtained for all the patients on days 15 and 30 and for 26 patients (13 in each treatment group) on day 60. Active rTMS significantly reduced pain and improved several aspects of quality of life (including fatigue, morning tiredness, general activity, walking and sleep) for up to 2 weeks after treatment had ended. The analgesic effects were observed from the fifth stimulation onwards and were not related to changes in mood or anxiety. The effects of rTMS were more long-lasting for affective than for sensory pain, suggesting differential effects on brain structures involved in pain perception. Only few minor and transient side effects were reported during the stimulation period. Our data indicate that unilateral rTMS of the motor cortex induces a long-lasting decrease in chronic widespread pain and may therefore constitute an effective alternative analgesic treatment for fibromyalgia.","{'Year': '2007', 'Month': 'Oct'}",our data indicate that unilateral rtms of the motor cortex induces a long-lasting decrease in chronic widespread pain and may therefore constitute an effective alternative analgesic treatment for fibromyalgia .,"<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">our data indicate that unilateral

Composite responder rates for the treatment of fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia pain (co-primary efficacy variables) were generally higher with milnacipran 100 or 200 mg/day (in two divided doses) than with placebo after 12 weeks of fixed-dose treatment.

She was diagnosed with traumatic CSF leak based on radioisotope cisternography.

Poor sleep is hypothesized to have a reciprocal relationship with pain, and over 75% of individuals with fibromyalgia report disturbed sleep. We hypothesized that measures of sleep would increase the predictive ability of the clinical pain model.

Combined use of pregabalin and memantine in fibromyalgia syndrome treatment : a novel analgesic and neuroprotective strategy ?,Combined use of pregabalin and memantine in fibromyalgia syndrome treatment: a novel analgesic and neuroprotective strategy?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19362430/,"Combined use of pregabalin and memantine in fibromyalgia syndrome treatment: a novel analgesic and neuroprotective strategy? Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic widespread pain syndrome that is estimated to affect 4-8 million US adults. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying this illness remain unclear, rendering most clinical treatment and management techniques relatively ineffective. It is now known that abnormalities in both nociceptive and central pain processing systems are necessary (but perhaps not sufficient) to condition the onset and maintenance of FMS.

The nondrug treatments for FM include the effects of far infrared radiation (FIR). Currently, FIR-emitting heat lamps and garments made of filaments (fibers) impregnated with FIR-emitting nanoparticles are being used to deliver thermal radiation effects. Objective • The study intended to determine the benefits of a fabric coated with bioceramics for reducing pain in women with FM. Design • The research team designed a randomized, controlled pilot study. Setting • The study was conducted in the laboratory of the Department of Corporal Expression, University of Jaén (Jaén, Spain). Participants • Thirty-nine female participants diagnosed with FM took part in the study. Intervention • Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (intervention) group (EG), n = 20, or a placebo group (PG), n = 19. The EG wore a shirt impregnated with bioceramics, and the PG dressed in a shirt without bioceramics. Both groups wore the shirts for 8 h/d for 60 d. Outcome Measures • Participants were evaluated twice, at baseline and postintervention. The tests used were (1) a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, (2) the FM Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and (3) the Short Form-12 health survey. The research team measured each participant's weight, height, and body mass index and evaluated their tender points. The research team also tracked participants' daily use of pain medications as a daily tablet intake. Results • Postintervention, the women in the EG showed a significant reduction in pain: (1) on the VAS (P &lt; .001), (2) on the measurement of tender points (P &lt; .001), and (3) on the algometer score (P &lt; .001), as well as (4) a significant reduction in FM symptoms on the FIQ (P = .005) and (5) a reduction in daily tablet intake (P &lt; .001). No significant changes in the PG group were found. Significant differences existed between the groups for the VAS, the FIQ, tender points, and the algometer score in posttest evaluation (P &lt; .05). Conclusions • Regular use of garments impregnated with a bioceramic solution (1%) can be beneficial in reducing pain and the impact of FM for patients.

Design • The research team designed a randomized, controlled pilot study. Setting • The study was conducted in the laboratory of the Department of Corporal Expression, University of Jaén (Jaén, Spain). Participants • Thirty-nine female participants diagnosed with FM took part in the study. Intervention • Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (intervention) group (EG), n = 20, or a placebo group (PG), n = 19. The EG wore a shirt impregnated with bioceramics, and the PG dressed in a shirt without bioceramics. Both groups wore the shirts for 8 h/d for 60 d. Outcome Measures • Participants were evaluated twice, at baseline and postintervention. The tests used were (1) a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, (2) the FM Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and (3) the Short Form-12 health survey. The research team measured each participant's weight, height, and body mass index and evaluated their tender points. The research team also tracked participants' daily use of pain medications as a daily tablet intake. Results • Postintervention, the women in the EG showed a significant reduction in pain: (1) on the VAS (P < .001), (2) on the measurement of tender points (P < .001), and (3) on the algometer score (P < .001), as well as (4) a significant reduction in FM symptoms on the FIQ (P = .005) and (5) a reduction in daily tablet intake (P < .001). No significant changes in the PG group were found. Significant differences existed between the groups for the VAS, the FIQ, tender points, and the algometer score in posttest evaluation (P < .05). Conclusions • Regular use of garments impregnated with a bioceramic solution (1%) can be beneficial in reducing pain and the impact of FM for patients. The low cost and comfort of the clothing make the therapy easy to be applied as a complementary tool in the treatment of FM.","{'Year': '2017', 'Month': 'Sep'}",context • the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia ( fm ) has centered on pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacological treatment .,"<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">context • the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia ( fm ) has centered on pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacological treatment .</div>"

Milnacipran, duloxetine, and venlafaxine, have all been reported to be effective in a number of chronic pain conditions, including the treatment of fibromyalgia where their analgesic effects are independent of comorbid depression.","{'Year': '2008', 'Month': 'Jul'}","milnacipran , duloxetine , and venlafaxine , have all been reported to be effective in a number of chronic pain conditions , including the treatment of fibromyalgia where their analgesic effects are independent of comorbid depression .","<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">

Although the mechanisms potentially linking chronic widespread pain, sleep alterations and mood disorders have not yet been proven, polysomnography findings in patients with fibromyalgia and non-restorative sleep and their relationships with clinical symptoms support the hypothesis of a conceptual common mechanism called 'central sensitisation'.

Treatment-related changes in activity management patterns were also examined. Patients with FMS (n = 178) were randomly assigned to an operant learning (OL; delayed [n = 36] or immediate [n = 54] groups) or an energy conservation (EC; delayed [n = 35] or immediate [n = 53] groups) treatment condition. Of these, 32 OL and 37 EC patients completed treatment. Forty-three patients were allocated to the delayed treatment condition (control group). Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to examine the effects of OL and EC treatments on primary (average pain and usual fatigue), secondary (pain and fatigue interference, physical and psychological function, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms), and tertiary (pain-related activity patterns) outcomes. Neither treatment was effective in reducing average pain or usual fatigue symptoms. Relative to EC, OL patients showed greater improvements in depressive symptoms, whereas nonsignificant trends (P values ranging between .05 and .06) were observed for pain interference, fatigue interference, and psychological function. Both treatments were associated with improvements in sleep quality and physical function, increases in pacing, and decreases in overdoing activity patterns.

There is moderate-level evidence that the effect of acupuncture does not differ from sham acupuncture in reducing pain or fatigue, or improving sleep or global well-being. EA is probably better than MA for pain and stiffness reduction and improvement of global well-being, sleep and fatigue. The effect lasts up to one month, but is not maintained at six months follow-up. MA probably does not improve pain or physical functioning. Acupuncture appears safe. People with fibromyalgia may consider using EA alone or with exercise and medication.

Milnacipran, a serotonin/noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor, has recently been approved in the USA for fibromyalgia, a chronic pathology characterized by diffused/chronic musculoskeletal pain, and a high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome. Here, we determined its antinociceptive efficacy in two visceral pain tests in rodents: the acetic acid-induced writhing model in mice and the butyrate/colonic distension assay in rats, a model of irritable bowel syndrome. Acute milnacipran (5-40 mg/kgi.p.) significantly and dose-dependently reduced writhing (72.2 ± 3.2 versus 17.0 ± 4.1 writhes at 40 mg/kg). Following repeated administration (40 m/kgi.p. for 5 days), milnacipran preserved its ability to significantly reduce writhing (76 ± 8.3 versus 21.1 ± 6.7 writhes).

Each of these properties suggests that antipsychotics could represent a new potential alternative for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome .,The role of antipsychotics in the management of fibromyalgia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296316/,"Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic generalized pain associated with different somatic symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, stiffness, balance problems, hypersensitivity to physical and psychological environmental stimuli, depression and anxiety. It has been estimated to affect roughly the 2-4% of the general population in most countries studied, and it has been shown to be much more prevalent in women than in men. Although its pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, it is known that both genetic and environmental factors are involved in its development. Fibromyalgia shares a high degree of co-morbidity with other conditions, including chronic headache, temporomandibular disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, major depression, anxiety disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome. Therefore, this is a syndrome difficult to treat for which multimodal treatments including physical exercise, psychological therapies and pharmacological treatment are recommended. Although different kinds of drugs have been studied for the treatment of fibromyalgia, the most widely used drugs that have the higher degree of evidence for efficacy include the α(2)δ ligands pregabalin and gabapentin, and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, there is a need to look for newer additional therapeutic pharmacological options for the treatment of this complex and disabling disease. First- and second-generation antipsychotics have shown analgesic properties both in an experimental setting and in humans, although most of the available evidence for the treatment of human pain concerns older antipsychotics and involves clinical trials performed several decades ago. In addition, several second-generation antipsychotics, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine, have shown efficacy in the treatment of some anxiety disorders. Some second-generation antipsychotics, mainly quetiapine, aripiprazole and amisulpride, have demonstrated antidepressant activity, with quetiapine approved for the treatment of bipolar depression and refractory major depression, and aripiprazole approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Finally, several old and new antipsychotics, including promethazine, levopromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone, have been shown to improve sleep parameters in healthy subjects. Each of these properties suggests that antipsychotics could represent a new potential alternative for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. To date, most of the published studies on the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome have been uncontrolled, either case reports or case series, dealing with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, levopromazine and amisulpride. The studies on olanzapine and quetiapine have suggested therapeutic efficacy although, in the case of olanzapine, hampered by tolerability problems. A double-blind controlled trial, published in 1980, showed that chlorpromazine increased slow-wave sleep and improved pain and mood disturbances. More recently, four double-blind controlled studies have explored the efficacy of quetiapine, either alone or as an add-on treatment, in fibromyalgia management. None of these trials has yet been published, although two of them have been presented as congress communications, both of them suggesting that quetiapine could be a potential alternative treatment for fibromyalgia. In summary, the current available evidence suggests that at least some antipsychotics, specifically quetiapine, could be useful for the treatment of fibromyalgia and that further studies on the efficacy of these compounds are worth pursuing.",22296316,2012-10-01,['Antipsychotic Agents'],"Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic generalized pain associated with different somatic symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, stiffness, balance problems, hypersensitivity to physical and psychological environmental stimuli, depression and anxiety.

Some second-generation antipsychotics, mainly quetiapine, aripiprazole and amisulpride, have demonstrated antidepressant activity, with quetiapine approved for the treatment of bipolar depression and refractory major depression, and aripiprazole approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Finally, several old and new antipsychotics, including promethazine, levopromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone, have been shown to improve sleep parameters in healthy subjects. Each of these properties suggests that antipsychotics could represent a new potential alternative for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. To date, most of the published studies on the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome have been uncontrolled, either case reports or case series, dealing with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, levopromazine and amisulpride. The studies on olanzapine and quetiapine have suggested therapeutic efficacy although, in the case of olanzapine, hampered by tolerability problems. A double-blind controlled trial, published in 1980, showed that chlorpromazine increased slow-wave sleep and improved pain and mood disturbances. More recently, four double-blind controlled studies have explored the efficacy of quetiapine, either alone or as an add-on treatment, in fibromyalgia management. None of these trials has yet been published, although two of them have been presented as congress communications, both of them suggesting that quetiapine could be a potential alternative treatment for fibromyalgia.

Fibromyalgia shares a high degree of co-morbidity with other conditions, including chronic headache, temporomandibular disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, major depression, anxiety disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome. Therefore, this is a syndrome difficult to treat for which multimodal treatments including physical exercise, psychological therapies and pharmacological treatment are recommended. Although different kinds of drugs have been studied for the treatment of fibromyalgia, the most widely used drugs that have the higher degree of evidence for efficacy include the α(2)δ ligands pregabalin and gabapentin, and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

After a 1-month period to obtain baseline data, milnacipran treatment was initiated and doses were titrated up to 100 mg/day over 1 month. Maintenance therapy continued for an additional 3 months. The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in the number of all headache days during the last 28 days of maintenance therapy analyzed, using last observation carried forward (LOCF).

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of aquatic exercises in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). A total of 63 patients were included and allocated to two groups. Group I (n = 33) received an aquatic exercise program and Group II (n = 30) received a home-based exercise program for 60 min, 3x a week, over 5 weeks. Patients were evaluated for pain (visual analogue scale, VAS), number of tender points (NTP), Beck depression inventory (BDI), and functional capacity (fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, FIQ). All assessment parameters were measured at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. There were statistically significant differences in FIQ and NTP in both groups at the end and during follow-up (P &lt; 0.05). Group I showed a statistically significant decrease in BDI scores after 4 and 12 weeks (P &lt; 0.05) that remained after 24 weeks (P &lt; 0.001). In Group II, a significant decrease in BDI scores was observed at the end and during follow-up (P &lt; 0.001).

Group I (n = 33) received an aquatic exercise program and Group II (n = 30) received a home-based exercise program for 60 min, 3x a week, over 5 weeks. Patients were evaluated for pain (visual analogue scale, VAS), number of tender points (NTP), Beck depression inventory (BDI), and functional capacity (fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, FIQ). All assessment parameters were measured at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. There were statistically significant differences in FIQ and NTP in both groups at the end and during follow-up (P < 0.05). Group I showed a statistically significant decrease in BDI scores after 4 and 12 weeks (P < 0.05) that remained after 24 weeks (P < 0.001).

In this study, we investigated PGB transport in rats, mammalian cell lines, and Xenopus laevis oocytes. In contrast to gabapentin (GBP), PGB absorption in rats showed unique linear pharmacokinetics. PGB entered CHO and Caco-2 cells predominately via Na(+)-independent processes. Uptake of PGB was mutually exclusive with leucine, GBP and 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid, the substrates preferential for system L. The preloaded PGB in CHO cells was exchangeable with leucine, but at a lower exchange rate than that of leucine and GBP. Dixon plots showed competitive inhibition of leucine uptake by PGB, with a K(i) value very close to the K(m) value for PGB uptake (377 versus 363 microM). At an extracellular concentration of 300 microM, the intracellular PGB concentration in CHO cells reached 1.5- and 23-fold higher than that of GBP and leucine, respectively.

Duloxetine achieves a maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of approximately 47 ng/mL (40 mg twice-daily dosing) to 110 ng/mL (80 mg twice-daily dosing) approximately 6 hours after dosing. The elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 10-12 hours and the volume of distribution is approximately 1640 L. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine with a focus on concomitant medications and their clinical implications. Patient demographic characteristics found to influence the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine include sex, smoking status, age, ethnicity, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype, hepatic function and renal function. Of these, only impaired hepatic function or severely impaired renal function warrant specific warnings or dose recommendations. Pharmacokinetic results from drug interaction studies show that activated charcoal decreases duloxetine exposure, and that CYP1A2 inhibition increases duloxetine exposure to a clinically significant degree. Specifically, following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and C(max) of duloxetine significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively.

This phase II open-label trial aims to define a methodology for a clinically effective treatment of pain in FM by establishing treatment protocols and screening procedures to maximize efficacy and response rate. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) provides targeted subthreshold brain stimulation, combining tolerability with specificity. We aimed to establish the number of HD-tDCS sessions required to achieve a 50% FM pain reduction, and to characterize the biometrics of the response, including brain network activation pain scores of contact heat-evoked potentials. We report a clinically significant benefit of a 50% pain reduction in half (n = 7) of the patients (N = 14), with responders and nonresponders alike benefiting from a cumulative effect of treatment, reflected in significant pain reduction (P = .035) as well as improved quality of life (P = .001) over time. We also report an aggregate 6-week response rate of 50% of patients and estimate 15 as the median number of HD-tDCS sessions to reach clinically meaningful outcomes.

"Low dose naltrexone has gained popularity as an off-label treatment of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease , as well as chronic pain disorders including fibromyalgia , complex regional pain syndrome , and diabetic neuropathy .","Pharmacology Update: Low-Dose Naltrexone as a Possible Nonopioid Modality for Some Chronic, Nonmalignant Pain Syndromes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30917675/,"Pain can have a devastating effect on the quality of life of patients in palliative medicine. Thus far, majority of research has been centered on opioid-based pain management, with a limited empirical evidence for the use of nonopioid medications in palliative care. However, opioid and nonopioid medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have their limitations in the clinical use due to risk of adverse effects, therefore, there is a need for more research to be directed to finding an alternative approach to pain management in comfort care setting. The purpose of this article is to discuss a potential new drug that would adequately alleviate pain and enhance quality of life without significant risks of adverse effects that would limit its use. Naltrexone is a reversible competitive antagonist at μ-opioid and κ-opioid receptors, which when used at standard doses of 50 to 150 mg was initially intended for use in opioid and alcohol use disorders. However, it was discovered that its use in low doses follows alternate pharmacodynamic pathways with various effects. When used in doses of 1 to 5 mg it acts as a glial modulator with a neuroprotective effect via inhibition of microglial activation. It binds to Toll-like receptor 4 and acts as an antagonist, therefore inhibiting the downstream cellular signaling pathways that ultimately lead to pro-inflammatory cytokines, therefore reducing inflammatory response. Its other mode of action involves transient opioid receptor blockade ensuing from low-dose use which upregulates opioid signaling resulting in increased levels of endogenous opioid production, known as opioid rebound effect. Low dose naltrexone has gained popularity as an off-label treatment of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as chronic pain disorders including fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy.

This article will therefore propose the potential off-label use of LDN in management of nonmalignant pain in the palliative medicine setting.",30917675,2020-02-10,"['Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Naltrexone']","Pain can have a devastating effect on the quality of life of patients in palliative medicine. Thus far, majority of research has been centered on opioid-based pain management, with a limited empirical evidence for the use of nonopioid medications in palliative care. However, opioid and nonopioid medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have their limitations in the clinical use due to risk of adverse effects, therefore, there is a need for more research to be directed to finding an alternative approach to pain management in comfort care setting. The purpose of this article is to discuss a potential new drug that would adequately alleviate pain and enhance quality of life without significant risks of adverse effects that would limit its use. Naltrexone is a reversible competitive antagonist at μ-opioid and κ-opioid receptors, which when used at standard doses of 50 to 150 mg was initially intended for use in opioid and alcohol use disorders. However, it was discovered that its use in low doses follows alternate pharmacodynamic pathways with various effects. When used in doses of 1 to 5 mg it acts as a glial modulator with a neuroprotective effect via inhibition of microglial activation. It binds to Toll-like receptor 4 and acts as an antagonist, therefore inhibiting the downstream cellular signaling pathways that ultimately lead to pro-inflammatory cytokines, therefore reducing inflammatory response. Its other mode of action involves transient opioid receptor blockade ensuing from low-dose use which upregulates opioid signaling resulting in increased levels of endogenous opioid production, known as opioid rebound effect. Low dose naltrexone has gained popularity as an off-label treatment of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as chronic pain disorders including fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) may also have utility in improving mood disorders and the potential to enhance the quality of life. This article will therefore propose the potential off-label use of LDN in management of nonmalignant pain in the palliative medicine setting.","{'Year': '2019', 'Month': 'Oct'}","low dose naltrexone has gained popularity as an off-label treatment of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease , as well as chronic pain disorders including fibromyalgia , complex regional pain syndrome , and diabetic neuropathy .","<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">low dose

Spironolactone is known to ameliorate mood and tension headache or migraine in women with premenstrual syndrome or clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. In a case series of women with treatment resistant FMS spironolactone was therefore added to their medication, and they were observed for at least 12 months. Methods 31 women with treatment-resistant FMS received spironolactone as add-on medication to various pain modulating drugs. 15 women responded to spironolactone and baseline data were compared with assessments over 12-14 months on treatment with spironolactone (ALDACTONE®) in dose range 100-200 mg/day. The efficacy was evaluated by the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) total score and 8 FIQ subtests, a German mood inventory (BSKE-EWL), and further assessments of changes in relevant psychological and physical complaints. 16 women had no effect and stopped the treatment early. Results The subsequent data refer to the 15 responders. The FIQ total score (maximal score = 80) decreased from 56.6 ± 10.0 at baseline to 17.1 ± 11.9 (mean ± SD) 12-14 months later, and pain intensity on an 11 point numeric rating scale (NRS) decreased from 8.8 ± 1.6 to 2.6 ± 1.9 (mean ± SD). Similar changes in FIQ subscores were found for fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. Emotional functioning consistently improved: positive mood from 20.0 ± 5.4 to 37.7 ± 5.4 (maximal score = 48), and negative mood from 35.4 ± 5.3 to 10.0 ± 4.4 (maximal score = 60) (each mean ± SD) as well as other mental and physical dysfunctions including non-restorative sleep. All these changes at 4-6 weeks remained on this level for 11-13 months. The drug was well-tolerated and safe, no serious adverse effects were observed. Regular monitoring of serum potassium did not reveal hyperkalemia. All 15 women were able to reduce or discontinue concomitant drugs. Conclusion Fifteen of 31 women with otherwise treatment-resistant FMS experienced a number of prolonged beneficial effects from spironolactone on their complex pain-condition. Implications and discussion We hypothesise that spironolactone affects several central and peripheral neurotransmitter systems such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity and dopaminergic transmission. The high rate of non-responsive patients underlines that FMS may represent several subgroups.

Women meeting 1990 ACR criteria for FM (N = 107) underwent psychological (childhood trauma, mood, anxiety, and stress) and biomedical (neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic) testing. Cluster analysis identified four distinct subgroups. Subgroups I, II, and III exhibited profiles that included high psychological distress. Subgroup I was further distinguished by a history of childhood maltreatment and hypocortisolism, and these women reported the most pain and disability. Subgroup II evinced more physiological dysregulation and also reported high levels of pain, fatigue, and disability. Subgroup III was characterized by normal biomarkers and reported intermediate pain severity with higher global functioning. Subgroup IV was distinguished by their psychological well-being, reporting less disability and pain. Our findings underscore the heterogeneity of both psychological and physiological features among FM patients presenting with nearly identical tender point counts.

Recent clinical studies suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors might play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. To determine whether an intravenous (IV) ketamine test predicts the response to a therapeutic trial with an oral N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, we performed a low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) IV ketamine infusion on 34 consecutive patients with FM, which was subsequently followed by an oral dextromethorphan (DX) treatment regimen. As per previous guidelines, the cutoff value for a positive response to the IV ketamine test was designated to be 67% pain relief, and a positive response to DX treatment was 50% pain reduction at 4- to 6-week follow-up visits. The degree of correlation between pain relief with ketamine and DX was highly significant (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.66; P < .001). Ten patients responded positively to both ketamine and DX, 19 responded to neither drug, 3 had a positive response to ketamine but not DX, and 2 obtained good pain relief with DX but not ketamine. The sensitivity of the IV ketamine test was 83%, the specificity was 86%, the positive predictive value was 77%, and the negative predictive value was 91%.

Exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors, as well as altered autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine responses, also may contribute to alterations in pain perception or pain inhibition. Understanding the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and co-occurring disorders may help clinicians provide the most appropriate treatment to their patients.",{'Year': '2008'},understanding the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and co-occurring disorders may help clinicians provide the most appropriate treatment to their patients .,"<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">understanding the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and co-occurring disorders may help clinicians provide the most appropriate treatment to their

Milnacipran failed to inhibit the UCD-induced EMG response, whether administered i.v. or intrathecally. Similarly, i.v. milnacipran, administered either acutely or chronically, failed to inhibit the CRD-induced EMG response. CRD and UCD are well established animal models for the study of acute visceral pain. Milnacipran, although it provides some unique advantages compared with other antidepressants, is unlikely to produce analgesia after acute administration in the setting of acute visceral pain.","{'Year': '2004', 'Month': 'May'}","milnacipran , an antidepressant that inhibits monoamine reuptake , is widely used in the treatment of depression and fibromyalgia .","<div class=""entities"" style=""line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"">

We assessed the nature of the disease by investigating the clinicoepidemiological aspect of our patients on the one hand and the response of the disease to both the old and new vitamin C infusion treatments with and without the use of 2 antibiotics on the other hand. Results are summarized as follows: a) the analysis of the medical records of our outpatients revealed that chronic type pneumonia epidemic in Nagoya Japan, with its onset of January 1995, showed no sign of its extinction by the end of May 1996.

Secondly, the former required the long term use of 2 antibiotics (erythromycin and chloramphenicol) together with regular practice of the old and new vitamin C infusion treatments for disease control, whereas the latter recovered from the disease after the short time use of a set of conventional cold remedies. c) The clinical manifestations of our chronic pneumonia patients showed good fitness to the criteria of CFS. d) CFS was distinguished from autoimmune disease-allergy complex by the method of clinical control: the former required the long-term use of 2 antibiotics together with regular practice of the old and new vitamin C infusion treatments, whereas the latter was controllable by the single use of the old vitamin C infusion treatment. e) The combined use of the old and new vitamin C infusion treatments rather than the single use of the old vitamin C infusion treatment was more effective for the control of CFS-a finding which suggests that deficient activities of both endogenous glucocorticoid and endogenous androgen in a CFS patient are somehow related to the genesis and further development of CFS. f) Evidence was available to indicate that the sole use of the new vitamin C infusion treatment may induce a state of gonadal steroid excess together with various other problems in the recipient.

"The present paper represents an extention of our vitamin C studies , and intends to investigate the problem whether or not chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , an acquired immunodeficiency disease , can also be counted as one of the candidate diseases for the vitamin C infusion treatment .",The value of the dehydroepiandrosterone-annexed vitamin C infusion treatment in the clinical control of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). I. A Pilot study of the new vitamin C infusion treatment with a volunteer CFS patient.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8986467/,"A series of publications from our laboratory have indicated that the practice of megadose vitamin C drip infusion treatment enhanced the activity of endogenous glucocorticoids in such a way as to improve the clinical course of allergy and autoimmune disease-a disease entity that is known to respond to the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids. The present paper represents an extention of our vitamin C studies, and intends to investigate the problem whether or not chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), an acquired immunodeficiency disease, can also be counted as one of the candidate diseases for the vitamin C infusion treatment. We prepared two kinds of vitamin C infusion sets for the clinical use: the dehydroepiandrosterone-annexed vitamin C infusion set (the new set) and the annex-free vitamin C infusion set (the old set). The new set was expected to enhance the endogenous activities of both glucocorticoids and gonadal steroids. We followed the clinical course of a male CFS patient using the old and new vitamin C infusion sets, and with and without the oral intake of erythromycin and chloramphenico. Results obtained are as follows: a) the observation period of a study subject covered a period of August 1995 to May 1996. Combination of pneumonia signs and dermatomyositis signs marked the onset of his CFS. b) Old infusion treatment together with the short term antibiotics treatment was found effective for the control of pneumonia in the first stage of the disease (from August to October, 1995). c) Signs of pneumonia recurrence gradually became eminent in the second stage of disease (from November, 1995, to January, 1996) in spite of the moderate frequency of the old treatment together with stepwise prolongation of the antibiotics treatment. d) The alternate practice of the old and new infusion treatments together with the long-term antibiotics treatment, as conducted in the 3rd stage of disease (from February to May, 1996) led to substantial extinction of pneumonia signs (leucocytosis, tachycardia etc). e) The practice of the new infusion treatment markedly increased the excretion of both 17-ketosteroids and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in the urine.

The present paper represents an extention of our vitamin C studies, and intends to investigate the problem whether or not chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), an acquired immunodeficiency disease, can also be counted as one of the candidate diseases for the vitamin C infusion treatment. We prepared two kinds of vitamin C infusion sets for the clinical use: the dehydroepiandrosterone-annexed vitamin C infusion set (the new set) and the annex-free vitamin C infusion set (the old set). The new set was expected to enhance the endogenous activities of both glucocorticoids and gonadal steroids. We followed the clinical course of a male CFS patient using the old and new vitamin C infusion sets, and with and without the oral intake of erythromycin and chloramphenico. Results obtained are as follows: a) the observation period of a study subject covered a period of August 1995 to May 1996. Combination of pneumonia signs and dermatomyositis signs marked the onset of his CFS. b) Old infusion treatment together with the short term antibiotics treatment was found effective for the control of pneumonia in the first stage of the disease (from August to October, 1995). c) Signs of pneumonia recurrence gradually became eminent in the second stage of disease (from November, 1995, to January, 1996) in spite of the moderate frequency of the old treatment together with stepwise prolongation of the antibiotics treatment. d) The alternate practice of the old and new infusion treatments together with the long-term antibiotics treatment, as conducted in the 3rd stage of disease (from February to May, 1996) led to substantial extinction of pneumonia signs (leucocytosis, tachycardia etc). e) The practice of the new infusion treatment markedly increased the excretion of both 17-ketosteroids and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in the urine. Evidence was also available to indicate that the dehydroepiandrosterone annex was converted to testosterone, which in turn made a contribution to the control of CFS. f) The immunological survey of lymphocyte subsets including NK cell percent failed to find a coherent change in a study subject with CFS.

"Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease ( SEID ) or myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME ) or chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) has an unknown aetiology , with no known treatment and a prevalence of approximately 22 million individuals ( 2 % ) in Western countries .",Suggested pathology of systemic exertion intolerance disease: Impairment of the E<sub>3</sub> subunit or crossover of swinging arms of the E<sub>2</sub> subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex decreases regeneration of cofactor dihydrolipoic acid of the E<sub>2</sub> subunit.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31383326/,"Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has an unknown aetiology, with no known treatment and a prevalence of approximately 22 million individuals (2%) in Western countries. Although strongly suspected, the role of lactate in pathology is unknown, nor has the nature of the two most central symptoms of the condition - post exertional malaise and fatigue. The proposed mechanism of action of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a central role in maintaining energy production with cofactors alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and its counterpart dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), its regeneration suggested as the new rate limiting factor. Decreased DHLA regeneration due to impairment of the E<sub>3</sub> subunit or crossover of the swinging arms of the E<sub>2</sub> subunit of PDC have been suggested as a cause of ME/CFS/SEID resulting in instantaneous fluctuations in lactate levels and instantaneous offset of the DHLA/LA ratio and defining the condition as an LA deficiency with chronic instantaneous hyperlactataemia with explicit stratification of symptoms. While instantaneous hyperlactataemia has been suggested to account for the PEM, the fatigue was explained by the downregulated throughput of pyruvate and consequently lower production of ATP with the residual enzymatic efficacy of the E<sub>3</sub> subunit or crossover of the E<sub>2</sub> as a proposed explanation of the fatigue severity.

Although strongly suspected, the role of lactate in pathology is unknown, nor has the nature of the two most central symptoms of the condition - post exertional malaise and fatigue. The proposed mechanism of action of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a central role in maintaining energy production with cofactors alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and its counterpart dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), its regeneration suggested as the new rate limiting factor. Decreased DHLA regeneration due to impairment of the E<sub>3</sub> subunit or crossover of the swinging arms of the E<sub>2</sub> subunit of PDC have been suggested as a cause of ME/CFS/SEID resulting in instantaneous fluctuations in lactate levels and instantaneous offset of the DHLA/LA ratio and defining the condition as an LA deficiency with chronic instantaneous hyperlactataemia with explicit stratification of symptoms. While instantaneous hyperlactataemia has been suggested to account for the PEM, the fatigue was explained by the downregulated throughput of pyruvate and consequently lower production of ATP with the residual enzymatic efficacy of the E<sub>3</sub> subunit or crossover of the E<sub>2</sub> as a proposed explanation of the fatigue severity.

All patients (n = 37) had a pituitary challenge test (human CRH) and a hypothalamic challenge test [either the insulin stress test (n = 16) or D-fenfluramine (n = 21)].

These differences were significant when ACTH responses were controlled. Urinary free cortisol levels were lower in the chronic fatigue syndrome group compared with the healthy group. These results indicate that ACTH responses to pituitary and hypothalamic challenges are intact in chronic fatigue syndrome and do not support previous findings of reduced central responses in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function or the hypothesis of abnormal CRH secretion in chronic fatigue syndrome.

The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) is based on patient history and treatment on cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise .,"Dysautonomia in chronic fatigue syndrome: facts, hypotheses, implications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14962627/,"The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is based on patient history and treatment on cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise. There is increasing evidence that dysautonomia occurs in CFS manifest primarily as disordered regulation of cardiovascular responses to stress. We impart our experience relating to diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of CFS based on identification and management of dysautonomia. Recently proposed methods for assessment of the cardiovascular reactivity, the 'hemodynamic instability score' (HIS) and the 'Fractal and Recurrence Analysis-based Score' (FRAS), served for this purpose. On HUTT, a particular dysautonomia is revealed in CFS patients that differ from dysautonomia in several other disorders. This distinct abnormality in CFS can be identified by HIS &gt;-0.98 (sensitivity 84.5% and specificity 85.1%) and FRAS &gt; +0.22 (sensitivity 70% and specificity 88%). Therefore, the HIS and FRAS may be used, in the appropriate clinical context, to support the diagnosis of CFS, which until now, could only be subjectively inferred.

There is increasing evidence that dysautonomia occurs in CFS manifest primarily as disordered regulation of cardiovascular responses to stress. We impart our experience relating to diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of CFS based on identification and management of dysautonomia. Recently proposed methods for assessment of the cardiovascular reactivity, the 'hemodynamic instability score' (HIS) and the 'Fractal and Recurrence Analysis-based Score' (FRAS), served for this purpose. On HUTT, a particular dysautonomia is revealed in CFS patients that differ from dysautonomia in several other disorders. This distinct abnormality in CFS can be identified by HIS >-0.98 (sensitivity 84.5% and specificity 85.1%) and FRAS > +0.22 (sensitivity 70% and specificity 88%). Therefore, the HIS and FRAS may be used, in the appropriate clinical context, to support the diagnosis of CFS, which until now, could only be subjectively inferred.

Characteristics of the formation of chronic fatigue syndrome and approaches to its treatment in young patients with focal brain damage .,Characteristics of the formation of chronic fatigue syndrome and approaches to its treatment in young patients with focal brain damage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17294097/,"Characteristics of the formation of chronic fatigue syndrome and approaches to its treatment in young patients with focal brain damage. Chronic fatigue is among the manifestations of focal brain lesions. It is most often encountered in multiple sclerosis (MS) and patients with the sequelae of traumatic, inflammatory, and vascular brain damage (encephalopathies). The aim of the present work was to study the mechanisms of formation of this syndrome in 50 patients with focal brain lesions of different origins (in the inactive stage) and to assess the possibility of correcting it using the combined agent Fezam (2 capsules t.i.d. for one month), which contains piracetam and cinarrizine. In patients with encephalopathies, chronic fatigue syndrome was directly associated with the severity of depression. Patients with MS showed changes in the value-sense sphere. Neuropsychological testing showed that the psychological and personality components played a greater role in the origins of chronic fatigue in patients with encephalopathies than in those with MS. Fezam significantly decreased the severity of chronic fatigue, particularly in patients with MS; in the second group (non-MS patients) this was accompanied by a decrease in the severity of depression. Mild side effects (in six patients--12%) consisted generally of sleep disturbances.

"Ampligen , currently under development by Hemispherx Biopharma in the US , acts on the immunological system through T-lymphocyte stimulation and is indicated for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , as part of the combined therapy .",Mismatched double-stranded RNA: polyI:polyC12U.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15357629/,"Ampligen [polyI:polyC12U] is a mismatched double-stranded RNA that acts by inducing interferon production (immunomodulator) and by activating an intracellular enzyme (RNase-L) against viral RNA transcripts (antiviral). Ampligen, currently under development by Hemispherx Biopharma in the US, acts on the immunological system through T-lymphocyte stimulation and is indicated for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as part of the combined therapy. Ampligen is available for licensing worldwide. In February 2004, Fujisawa Deutschland GmbH, a subsidiary of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., entered into an option agreement with Hemispherx Biopharma with the intent of becoming a distributor for Ampligen for the potential treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. An option fee of 400,000 euros was paid pursuant to the terms of the option agreement and upon execution of the Distribution Agreement, Fujisawa will pay Hemispherx fees and milestone payments with a potential worth of several millions of dollars. In September 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma Inc. entered into an agreement with Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation to organise clinical trials, marketing, sales and distribution for both of its lead compounds, Ampligen and Alferon N in the People's Republic of China. The agreement stipulates that the Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation (GMC) will conduct clinical trials with Ampligen for the treatment of HIV. All costs related to the trials are to be covered by GMC. Additionally, GMC has to develop and implement marketing and promotional programmes. In May 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma and the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy entered into a research project agreement that will see Ampligen implemented in a protocol used in patients with relapsed EBV-positive Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In March 2002, Esteve and Hemispherx Biopharma entered into a collaborative agreement under which Esteve will be the sole distributor of Ampligen in Spain, Portugal and Andorra for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Under this agreement, in addition to other terms, Esteve will also collaborate in the drug product development by conducting clinical studies in Spain in patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. In July 2001 Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it had formed a strategic alliance with Empire Health Resources for clinical trials of Ampligen in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. Empire Health Resources, a healthcare management firm, will be responsible for accrual and retention of patients for HIV trials, and protocols for trials in patients with hepatitis C or both HIV and hepatitis C infections. Hemispherx has entered into a collaboration with RED Laboratories, and RED Laboratories NV expects that this will facilitate the continued development of Ampligen. Hemispherx has also entered into an agreement with Schering Plough to use a Schering facility as its principal manufacturing platform in the US. This agreement may be expanded to include other territories. Hemispherx and AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals have signed a marketing agreement for Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome for Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In an arrangement between Hemispherx and Bioclones, Bioclones has certain marketing rights for Ampligen in the Southern Hemisphere, UK and Ireland. In the US, Ampligen has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of AIDS, renal cell carcinoma (phase II, completed), chronic fatigue syndrome (phase III) and invasive/metastatic malignant melanoma (phase II). In August 2004, Hemispherx announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of company stock to complete the clinical work for its immunotherapeutics/ antivirals Ampligen and Oragens. Previously, Hemispherx submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of th;) for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of the regulatory review has been cleared. In 2000, Hemispherx Europe (Hemispherx) obtained orphan drug status for Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in the EU, providing Hemispherx with 10 years of marketing exclusivity following the launch of the drug, as well as potential financial research benefits for the agent. In February 2000, Crystaal Corporation (now Biovail Pharmaceuticals Canada) acquired exclusive marketing rights to Ampligen in Canada, where it submitted an NDA for the agent for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. In the meantime, Ampligen has been available since May 1996 under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Programme for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and immune dysfunction syndrome by Rivex Pharma (Helix BioPharma). Bioclones has initiated clinical studies with Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Australia. The active substance for Ampligen is manufactured by F.H. Faulding Ltd. Clinical treatment programmes for chronic fatigue syndrome in other Pacific Rim countries are planned. Ampligen is available for severe chronic fatigue syndrome on a named patient, cost-recovery basis in South Africa. Hemispherx has developed a 'ready-to-use' liquid formulation of the drug and has begun treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in ongoing clinical trials. Hemispherx has also developed an oral version of the drug (Oragen), which is undergoing preclinical evaluation. In February 2001, Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it was initiating phase II/III trials of Ampligen in the treatment of late-stage, multidrug-resistant strains of HIV in the European Union. Patients treated in these studies will have exhausted all other treatment options. In July 2001, Hemispherx stated that Ampligen was being evaluated in a phase IIb trial in patients with HIV in the US. The trial, comprising two studies, REARMI and REARMII (Research/Evaluation of Ampligen for Retroviral Mutations I and II), will evaluate the ability of Ampligen to prevent the emergence of mutated, drug-resistant strains of the virus. 'Several hundred' patients currently on antiretroviral therapy and at risk of viral relapse will be enrolled at centres in Connecticut, New York, Florida and California. A second phase IIb study evaluating the effect of Ampligen on structured treatment interruptions (STI) is also underway. Final results from this study were reported in December 2002. NIH sponsored studies of potential therapies for SARS have identified Ampligen as having unusually high and consistent antiviral activity against human coronavirus, the pathogen implicated as the causative agent of the disease. Ampligen demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 microg/mL) and had a favourable safety profile. In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promising new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen and Alferon N. Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates. Researchers at the Rega Institute in Belgium have published results from an animal study demonstrating that Ampligen was superior at protecting mice against coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis compared with pegylated interferon. In May 2004 Hemispherx announced that it had filed an expanded US patent application covering the use of Ampligen for the potential treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dreaded emerging viruses.",15357629,2009-09-24,"['Anti-HIV Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'Poly U', 'poly(I).poly(c12,U)', 'Poly I-C']","Ampligen [polyI:polyC12U] is a mismatched double-stranded RNA that acts by inducing interferon production (immunomodulator) and by activating an intracellular enzyme (RNase-L) against viral RNA transcripts (antiviral).

In February 2001, Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it was initiating phase II/III trials of Ampligen in the treatment of late-stage, multidrug-resistant strains of HIV in the European Union. Patients treated in these studies will have exhausted all other treatment options. In July 2001, Hemispherx stated that Ampligen was being evaluated in a phase IIb trial in patients with HIV in the US. The trial, comprising two studies, REARMI and REARMII (Research/Evaluation of Ampligen for Retroviral Mutations I and II), will evaluate the ability of Ampligen to prevent the emergence of mutated, drug-resistant strains of the virus. 'Several hundred' patients currently on antiretroviral therapy and at risk of viral relapse will be enrolled at centres in Connecticut, New York, Florida and California. A second phase IIb study evaluating the effect of Ampligen on structured treatment interruptions (STI) is also underway. Final results from this study were reported in December 2002. NIH sponsored studies of potential therapies for SARS have identified Ampligen as having unusually high and consistent antiviral activity against human coronavirus, the pathogen implicated as the causative agent of the disease. Ampligen demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 microg/mL) and had a favourable safety profile. In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promising new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen and Alferon N. Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates. Researchers at the Rega Institute in Belgium have published results from an animal study demonstrating that Ampligen was superior at protecting mice against coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis compared with pegylated interferon. In May 2004 Hemispherx announced that it had filed an expanded US patent application covering the use of Ampligen for the potential treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dreaded emerging viruses.",15357629,2009-09-24,"['Anti-HIV Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'Poly U', 'poly(I).poly(c12,U)', 'Poly I-C']","Ampligen [polyI:polyC12U] is a mismatched double-stranded RNA that acts by inducing interferon production (immunomodulator) and by activating an intracellular enzyme (RNase-L) against viral RNA transcripts (antiviral). Ampligen, currently under development by Hemispherx Biopharma in the US, acts on the immunological system through T-lymphocyte stimulation and is indicated for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as part of the combined therapy. Ampligen is available for licensing worldwide. In February 2004, Fujisawa Deutschland GmbH, a subsidiary of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., entered into an option agreement with Hemispherx Biopharma with the intent of becoming a distributor for Ampligen for the potential treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. An option fee of 400,000 euros was paid pursuant to the terms of the option agreement and upon execution of the Distribution Agreement, Fujisawa will pay Hemispherx fees and milestone payments with a potential worth of several millions of dollars. In September 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma Inc. entered into an agreement with Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation to organise clinical trials, marketing, sales and distribution for both of its lead compounds, Ampligen and Alferon N in the People's Republic of China. The agreement stipulates that the Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation (GMC) will conduct clinical trials with Ampligen for the treatment of HIV. All costs related to the trials are to be covered by GMC. Additionally, GMC has to develop and implement marketing and promotional programmes. In May 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma and the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy entered into a research project agreement that will see Ampligen implemented in a protocol used in patients with relapsed EBV-positive Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In March 2002, Esteve and Hemispherx Biopharma entered into a collaborative agreement under which Esteve will be the sole distributor of Ampligen in Spain, Portugal and Andorra for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Under this agreement, in addition to other terms, Esteve will also collaborate in the drug product development by conducting clinical studies in Spain in patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. In July 2001 Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it had formed a strategic alliance with Empire Health Resources for clinical trials of Ampligen in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. Empire Health Resources, a healthcare management firm, will be responsible for accrual and retention of patients for HIV trials, and protocols for trials in patients with hepatitis C or both HIV and hepatitis C infections. Hemispherx has entered into a collaboration with RED Laboratories, and RED Laboratories NV expects that this will facilitate the continued development of Ampligen. Hemispherx has also entered into an agreement with Schering Plough to use a Schering facility as its principal manufacturing platform in the US. This agreement may be expanded to include other territories. Hemispherx and AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals have signed a marketing agreement for Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome for Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In an arrangement between Hemispherx and Bioclones, Bioclones has certain marketing rights for Ampligen in the Southern Hemisphere, UK and Ireland. In the US, Ampligen has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of AIDS, renal cell carcinoma (phase II, completed), chronic fatigue syndrome (phase III) and invasive/metastatic malignant melanoma (phase II). In August 2004, Hemispherx announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of company stock to complete the clinical work for its immunotherapeutics/ antivirals Ampligen and Oragens.

In May 2004 Hemispherx announced that it had filed an expanded US patent application covering the use of Ampligen for the potential treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dreaded emerging viruses.",15357629,2009-09-24,"['Anti-HIV Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'Poly U', 'poly(I).poly(c12,U)', 'Poly I-C']","Ampligen [polyI:polyC12U] is a mismatched double-stranded RNA that acts by inducing interferon production (immunomodulator) and by activating an intracellular enzyme (RNase-L) against viral RNA transcripts (antiviral). Ampligen, currently under development by Hemispherx Biopharma in the US, acts on the immunological system through T-lymphocyte stimulation and is indicated for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as part of the combined therapy. Ampligen is available for licensing worldwide. In February 2004, Fujisawa Deutschland GmbH, a subsidiary of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., entered into an option agreement with Hemispherx Biopharma with the intent of becoming a distributor for Ampligen for the potential treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. An option fee of 400,000 euros was paid pursuant to the terms of the option agreement and upon execution of the Distribution Agreement, Fujisawa will pay Hemispherx fees and milestone payments with a potential worth of several millions of dollars. In September 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma Inc. entered into an agreement with Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation to organise clinical trials, marketing, sales and distribution for both of its lead compounds, Ampligen and Alferon N in the People's Republic of China. The agreement stipulates that the Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation (GMC) will conduct clinical trials with Ampligen for the treatment of HIV. All costs related to the trials are to be covered by GMC. Additionally, GMC has to develop and implement marketing and promotional programmes. In May 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma and the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy entered into a research project agreement that will see Ampligen implemented in a protocol used in patients with relapsed EBV-positive Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In March 2002, Esteve and Hemispherx Biopharma entered into a collaborative agreement under which Esteve will be the sole distributor of Ampligen in Spain, Portugal and Andorra for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Under this agreement, in addition to other terms, Esteve will also collaborate in the drug product development by conducting clinical studies in Spain in patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. In July 2001 Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it had formed a strategic alliance with Empire Health Resources for clinical trials of Ampligen in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. Empire Health Resources, a healthcare management firm, will be responsible for accrual and retention of patients for HIV trials, and protocols for trials in patients with hepatitis C or both HIV and hepatitis C infections. Hemispherx has entered into a collaboration with RED Laboratories, and RED Laboratories NV expects that this will facilitate the continued development of Ampligen. Hemispherx has also entered into an agreement with Schering Plough to use a Schering facility as its principal manufacturing platform in the US. This agreement may be expanded to include other territories. Hemispherx and AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals have signed a marketing agreement for Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome for Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In an arrangement between Hemispherx and Bioclones, Bioclones has certain marketing rights for Ampligen in the Southern Hemisphere, UK and Ireland. In the US, Ampligen has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of AIDS, renal cell carcinoma (phase II, completed), chronic fatigue syndrome (phase III) and invasive/metastatic malignant melanoma (phase II). In August 2004, Hemispherx announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of company stock to complete the clinical work for its immunotherapeutics/ antivirals Ampligen and Oragens. Previously, Hemispherx submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of th;) for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of the regulatory review has been cleared. In 2000, Hemispherx Europe (Hemispherx) obtained orphan drug status for Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in the EU, providing Hemispherx with 10 years of marketing exclusivity following the launch of the drug, as well as potential financial research benefits for the agent. In February 2000, Crystaal Corporation (now Biovail Pharmaceuticals Canada) acquired exclusive marketing rights to Ampligen in Canada, where it submitted an NDA for the agent for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. In the meantime, Ampligen has been available since May 1996 under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Programme for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and immune dysfunction syndrome by Rivex Pharma (Helix BioPharma). Bioclones has initiated clinical studies with Ampligen for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Australia. The active substance for Ampligen is manufactured by F.H. Faulding Ltd. Clinical treatment programmes for chronic fatigue syndrome in other Pacific Rim countries are planned. Ampligen is available for severe chronic fatigue syndrome on a named patient, cost-recovery basis in South Africa. Hemispherx has developed a 'ready-to-use' liquid formulation of the drug and has begun treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in ongoing clinical trials. Hemispherx has also developed an oral version of the drug (Oragen), which is undergoing preclinical evaluation. In February 2001, Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it was initiating phase II/III trials of Ampligen in the treatment of late-stage, multidrug-resistant strains of HIV in the European Union. Patients treated in these studies will have exhausted all other treatment options. In July 2001, Hemispherx stated that Ampligen was being evaluated in a phase IIb trial in patients with HIV in the US. The trial, comprising two studies, REARMI and REARMII (Research/Evaluation of Ampligen for Retroviral Mutations I and II), will evaluate the ability of Ampligen to prevent the emergence of mutated, drug-resistant strains of the virus. 'Several hundred' patients currently on antiretroviral therapy and at risk of viral relapse will be enrolled at centres in Connecticut, New York, Florida and California. A second phase IIb study evaluating the effect of Ampligen on structured treatment interruptions (STI) is also underway. Final results from this study were reported in December 2002. NIH sponsored studies of potential therapies for SARS have identified Ampligen as having unusually high and consistent antiviral activity against human coronavirus, the pathogen implicated as the causative agent of the disease. Ampligen demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 microg/mL) and had a favourable safety profile. In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promising new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen and Alferon N. Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates.

Chronic fatigue (CF) is a syndrome manifesting in cases with focal brain damage. It is frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and encephalopathies (post-traumatic, cerebrovascular, etc). Treatment of this syndrome remains problematic. The study aimed to analyze the genesis of CF in patients with different non-active neurological diseases with brain damage and possibility of its treatment with the complex drug fezam (piracetam plus cinnarizin) in dosage 2 capsules 3 times per day. Before the treatment, all the patients had CF, which was directly associated with severity of depression in patients with encephalopathies. In MS patients, changes in the valuable-and-sense sphere that plays a significant role in human behavior and activity underlying self-regulation in critical situations were found. Neuropsychological data revealed that in patients with encephalopathies psychological and behavioral aspects were more significant in regard with CF genesis than in patients with MS.

The purpose of this study is to clarify whether baseline severity of fatigue symptom would influence the efficacy of rTMS applied for ME patients. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-two patients with ME were studied. Each patient was hospitalized to receive 6-8 sessions of rTMS. In this study, high-frequency rTMS of 10 Hz was applied over prefrontal cortex. To evaluate the severity of fatigue symptom, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) rate were applied before and after rTMS application.
